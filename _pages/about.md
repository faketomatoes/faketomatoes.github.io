Welcome to my homepage! I am a postdoctoral researcher in Statistics at the University of Pennsylvania, working with Prof. [Yuxin Chen](https://yuxinchen2020.github.io/). I obtained my PhD in Statistics from the School of Mathematics, Peking University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Zhihua Zhang](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/zhzhang/).



Research

My current research interests focus on dealing with statistical problems and tasks in various environmental settings via streaming methods. These tasks encompass estimation, inference, and online decision-making. My primary approach involves delving into the realm of stochastic approximation to address these challenges effectively. Throughout my research journey, I am dedicated to uncovering commonalities in these online statistical methods, stochastic dynamics, and structured random sampling.
